## Volunteer!

Aromas Day is run by a small but dedicated group of volunteers. If you want to give back and make the next Aromas Day
better, we'd love to have you as a volunteer.

Currently, there are three good ways to make a contribution:

- First, you can apply to have a booth at Aromas Day! We're accepting applications now for non-profit booths, garage sale alley spaces, vendors selling artisan goods, and informational booths. Please apply via this form:

- You can attend the organizers meetings, which are held 7-8pm, 2nd Wednesdays of the
  month at [The Aromas Grange](https://aromasgrange.org/).

    - We have volunteer opportunities for a variety of tasks and a variety of time commitments. Even if you only
      have a couple of hours to offer, we would love your help.
    - Once you get on our list, we'll get back to you two weeks before Aromas Day during a volunteer meeting to match
      you to an assignment.
