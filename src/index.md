## Volunteer!

Aromas Day is run by a small but dedicated group of volunteers. If you want to give back and make the next Aromas Day
better, we'd love to have you as a volunteer.

Currently, there are two good ways to make a contribution:

- You can attend the organizers meetings, which are held 7-8pm, 2nd Wednesdays of the
  month at [The Aromas Grange](https://aromasgrange.org/).
- [Email us](mailto:organizers+volunteer@aromasday.org) asking to be added to a list of "day-of" volunteers.
    - We have volunteer opportunities for a variety of _tasks_ and a variety of _time commitments_. Even if you only
      have a couple of hours to offer, we would love your help.
    - Once you get on our list, we'll get back to you two weeks before Aromas Day during a volunteer meeting to match
      you to an assignment.
