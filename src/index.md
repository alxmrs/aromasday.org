Aromas Day is run by a small but dedicated group of volunteers. If you want to give back and make the next Aromas Day
better, we'd love to have you as a volunteer.

Currently, there are two good ways to make a contribution:

- You can attend the organizers meetings, which are held 7-8pm, 2nd Wednesdays of the
  month at [The Aromas Grange](https://aromasgrange.org/).
- Apply to be a day-of volunteer with this form!

  [Volunteer Application](https://forms.gle/sHu5cCoFgh8zoFeJA){.footer-button}
    - We have volunteer opportunities for a variety of tasks and a variety of time commitments. Even if you only
      have a couple of hours to offer, we would love your help.
    - Once you get on our list, we'll get back to you two weeks before Aromas Day during a volunteer meeting to match
      you to an assignment.
